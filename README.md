# KNS-VPN
Secure &amp; Stealth VPN client for windows (Linux server with openvpn &amp; stunnel)

This Repository contain the client (developped in powershell) with a documentation on how to use it.
They are also a full script to create the vpn server on Debian 7 wheezy with basic setting. 

I will create a full documentation on the usage of the client & the server creation ASAP
